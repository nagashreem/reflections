How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    FC listed out the differences between the two files

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    I dont have to remember all the changes I made to my work

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    You can choose the right time to save and document your changes

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    sometimes you will need to see the changes done in multiple files in one go when they are connected to each other

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

   git log lists all teh changes made to a particular file.
   git diff lists the differences between any two saved versions of the file in git repository.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Because you can always go back to the previous committed versions to see where the bug was introduced and revert the buggy changes.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I would like to try and add some new files, edit and commit multiple versions, branch from someone elses code, clone etc..
