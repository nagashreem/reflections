How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
staging area operates on the Git and it shows/holds the files that are to be added and modified through Git while the working directory is just a directory which contains the files.

It provides a place to pull out only those files that you need work on while ensuring other files are untouched/unmodified.
